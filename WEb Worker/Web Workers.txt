Web worker:

	Bydefault our html page has only one main thread.
	And a main thread can handle only one javascript file 
	at a time.

	If you want to execute multiple javascript codes together
	and wants to change multiple things in your html page 
	together.

	You can create web worker.
	Multiple web workers can handle multiple javascript file.	
	Means You can run multiple javascript code together
	concurrently.


Types of web workers:

	1) Dedicated web worker:
		Which only works for one html file.

	2) Shared web worker:
		Which can work for more than one html file.
